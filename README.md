# Joe Robertson's dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles, just a collection of useful config files for utilities I commonly use

## Installing

Run `setup_once.sh` once, this will install Homebrew and Oh My ZSH.

Then run `setup.sh` which should install other bits and pieces, you should run this fairly often to update things.

Then at any time you should be able to call `rcup` to update all symlinks etc.
